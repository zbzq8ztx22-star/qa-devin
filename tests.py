After you are done, send a message with all the CHECKs you did and what the results were. Your structured output should be a json object with 'success' (boolean) and 'message' (string). The message should include whether each CHECK you ran passed or failed (and a reason if it failed).

Then click on the Library.
Then click on the Secrets page

First we will create a new secret using the "Create Secret" button.
Create a plain text secret with the key "TEST_NAME_1234" and the value "TEST_VALUE" and replace the 123 with a random number which you will generate.
CHECK: The secret was created and it is visible in the list.

Now delete the secret you just created.
CHECK: The secret was deleted. That it is no longer visible in the list.

Now we will try to bulk upload secrets. Create a test file with 3 secrets in it:
```
FILE_TEST_1="hi=abcd"
export secret2=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/db
# export FILE_TEST_3="hey=123"
```
Delete secrets FILE_TEST_1 and secret2 if they already exist in the UI.
Then upload the file using "import secrets" button. Mark it as sensitive.
If it shows an error about there being duplicate secrets thats fine, you can ignore that and just continue because these secrets already exist.
CHECK: ensure that 2 secrets were shown and that the third one was not shown (since it starts with a #)

Add the secrets.
